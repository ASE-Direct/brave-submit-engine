# Environmental Impact Enhancement

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Enhanced environmental impact calculations with more accurate metrics and added new tracking for plastic reduction and shipping weight savings. Updated PDF reports to display all environmental metrics.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated Plastic Reduction Calculation**

**Previous:** 0.5 lbs per cartridge  
**New:** 2 lbs per cartridge

This provides a more accurate representation of the plastic waste reduction achieved through higher-yield cartridge recommendations.

**Code Location:** `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`
```typescript
plasticReduced += cartridgesSavedHere * 2; // 2 lbs plastic per cartridge
```

### 2. **Added Shipping Weight Savings Tracking**

**New Metric:** Tracks the shipping weight saved when fewer cartridges are needed.

**Calculation:**
- **Toner cartridges:** 2.5 lbs saved per cartridge
- **Ink cartridges:** 0.2 lbs saved per cartridge

**Code Location:** `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`
```typescript
const shippingWeightPerCartridge = isToner ? 2.5 : 0.2;
shippingWeightSaved += cartridgesSavedHere * shippingWeightPerCartridge;
```

### 3. **Enhanced PDF Report Display**

Updated the Environmental Impact section in PDF reports to display 5 metrics in a 2-row layout:

**Row 1 (3 columns):**
- Cartridges Saved
- CO₂ Reduced (lbs)
- Trees Equivalent

**Row 2 (2 columns):**
- Plastic Reduced (lbs) - **NEW**
- Shipping Weight Saved (lbs) - **NEW**

**Code Location:** `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator.ts`

The environmental impact box was increased from 35 to 55 units height to accommodate the additional row.

### 4. **Database Schema Updates**

**Migration Created:** `add_shipping_weight_saved_to_savings_reports`

**Table:** `savings_reports`

**New Column:**
```sql
shipping_weight_saved_pounds NUMERIC(10,2) DEFAULT 0
```

**Updated Columns (values calculated differently):**
- `plastic_reduced_pounds` - Now uses 2 lbs per cartridge calculation

### 5. **Individual Item Environmental Savings**

Updated the `environmental_savings` JSONB field in `order_items_extracted` to include:
```typescript
environmental_savings: {
  cartridges_saved: number,
  co2_reduced: number,
  plastic_reduced: number,        // NEW
  shipping_weight_saved: number   // NEW
}
```

### 6. **Summary Object Updates**

Updated the savings analysis summary returned by `calculateSavings()`:
```typescript
environmental: {
  cartridges_saved: number,
  co2_reduced_pounds: number,
  trees_saved: number,
  plastic_reduced_pounds: number,           // Updated calculation
  shipping_weight_saved_pounds: number      // NEW
}
```

## Environmental Impact Calculation Details

### Complete Calculation Flow

When a higher-yield recommendation is made:

1. **Calculate Cartridges Saved**
   ```
   cartridges_saved = original_quantity - recommended_quantity
   ```

2. **Calculate CO2 Reduction**
   ```
   co2_reduced = cartridges_saved × (5.2 for toner OR 2.5 for ink)
   ```

3. **Calculate Plastic Reduction**
   ```
   plastic_reduced = cartridges_saved × 2 lbs
   ```

4. **Calculate Shipping Weight Savings**
   ```
   shipping_weight_saved = cartridges_saved × (2.5 for toner OR 0.2 for ink)
   ```

5. **Calculate Trees Saved**
   ```
   trees_saved = co2_reduced / 48
   ```
   *(Based on 1 tree absorbing ~48 lbs CO2/year)*

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** User orders 5 standard HP 64 ink cartridges, system recommends 3 HP 64XL

| Metric | Calculation | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Cartridges Saved | 5 - 3 | 2 cartridges |
| CO2 Reduced | 2 × 2.5 lbs | 5.0 lbs |
| Trees Saved | 5.0 / 48 | 0.10 trees |
| Plastic Reduced | 2 × 2 lbs | 4.0 lbs |
| Shipping Weight Saved | 2 × 0.2 lbs | 0.4 lbs |

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`
   - Added `plasticReduced` and `shippingWeightSaved` tracking variables
   - Updated environmental impact calculation logic
   - Enhanced individual item environmental_savings object
   - Updated summary return object

2. ✅ `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator.ts`
   - Expanded Environmental Impact box (35 → 55 height)
   - Added Row 2 with Plastic Reduced and Shipping Weight Saved
   - Updated layout to 2-row design

3. ✅ `CURRENT_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - Added `shipping_weight_saved_pounds` to savings_reports table documentation
   - Updated "Recent Changes" section with enhancement details
   - Added calculation details (2 lbs plastic, 2.5/0.2 lbs shipping weight)

4. ✅ **Database Migration**
   - Created migration: `add_shipping_weight_saved_to_savings_reports`
   - Added `shipping_weight_saved_pounds` column to `savings_reports` table

## Constants Used

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| CO2 per Toner | 5.2 lbs | Environmental impact per toner cartridge |
| CO2 per Ink | 2.5 lbs | Environmental impact per ink cartridge |
| Plastic per Cartridge | 2.0 lbs | Plastic waste per cartridge |
| Shipping Weight (Toner) | 2.5 lbs | Shipping weight per toner cartridge |
| Shipping Weight (Ink) | 0.2 lbs | Shipping weight per ink cartridge |
| CO2 per Tree | 48 lbs/year | Tree absorption rate for conversion |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload test documents** with both toner and ink cartridges
2. **Verify calculations** for different product categories
3. **Check PDF report** displays all 5 environmental metrics correctly
4. **Validate database** stores all environmental fields properly
5. **Test edge cases** (no savings, mixed toner/ink orders)

## Impact
