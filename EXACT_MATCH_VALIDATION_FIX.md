# Exact Match Validation Fix

## Problem
The system was matching items from completely unrelated documents using fuzzy, semantic, or AI-based matching methods. This allowed documents with no actual matching products to generate false savings reports.

## Solution
Implemented **strict validation** that requires at least ONE exact match before accepting any product match, regardless of the matching method used.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Exact Product Name Matching (Tier 1.5)
Added a new `exactProductNameMatch()` function that performs case-insensitive exact product name matching:
- Returns score 1.0 ONLY for exact matches
- Called early in the matching process (right after exact SKU matching)
- Uses efficient SQL query with ILIKE operator

### 2. Strict Validation Logic
Added validation at the end of `matchSingleProduct()` that checks:
- **Exact SKU Match**: `method === 'exact_sku'` AND `score === 1.0`
- **Exact Product Name Match**: `method === 'exact_name'` AND `score === 1.0`

If neither condition is met, the match is **rejected** and the item is marked as unmatched.

### 3. Match Methods Affected
The following matching methods will now be rejected unless accompanied by an exact match:
- ❌ `fuzzy_sku` (Tier 2) - Even with high scores (0.90+)
- ❌ `combined_search` (Tier 3) - SKU + description combinations
- ❌ `ilike_search` (Tier 3.5) - Unless it's an exact match (score 1.0)
- ❌ `description_search` (Tier 4) - SKU found in descriptions
- ❌ `full_text` (Tier 5) - Full-text search results
- ❌ `semantic` (Tier 6) - Semantic/vector similarity
- ❌ `ai_suggested` (Tier 7) - AI agent suggestions

### 4. Accepted Match Methods
Only these methods are accepted:
- ✅ `exact_sku` - Exact match on any SKU field (sku, oem_number, wholesaler_sku, staples_sku, depot_sku)
- ✅ `exact_name` - Exact product name match (case-insensitive)

## Impact

### Before Fix
```
❌ Unrelated document → Fuzzy matches → False savings report
```

### After Fix
```
✅ Unrelated document → No exact matches → All items marked as unmatched → No false savings
✅ Valid document → Exact matches found → Accurate savings report
```

## Matching Flow

```
1. Try Exact SKU Match (Tier 1)
   └─ If found → ACCEPT & RETURN

2. Try Exact Product Name Match (Tier 1.5)
   └─ If found → ACCEPT & RETURN

3. Try Fuzzy/Semantic/AI Matches (Tiers 2-7)
   └─ Best match found

4. VALIDATION CHECK:
   ├─ Has exact SKU match? → ACCEPT
   ├─ Has exact product name match? → ACCEPT
   └─ Otherwise → REJECT (mark as unmatched)
```

## Logging
Enhanced logging shows validation status:
```
✓ EXACT MATCH VALIDATED: Exact SKU match found
✓ EXACT MATCH VALIDATED: Exact product name match found
⚠️  MATCH REJECTED: No exact SKU or product name match found
```

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Upload a document with completely unrelated data
2. System should return 0 matched items (or very few if there are coincidental exact matches)
3. No savings should be calculated for unmatched items

## Deployment
This fix is in the Edge Function and will take effect immediately upon deployment:
```bash
supabase functions deploy process-document
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Prevents false positive matches
- ✅ Ensures data integrity
- ✅ Maintains accuracy of savings reports
- ✅ Protects against garbage data
- ✅ Requires verifiable exact matches for all results
