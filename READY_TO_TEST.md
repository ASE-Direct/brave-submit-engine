# ✅ READY TO TEST - Email System Fixed!

## 🎯 What Was The Problem?

**Resend was in sandbox mode** using `onboarding@resend.dev`, which only allows sending to verified email addresses.

- ✅ `areyes@gowaffl.com` was verified → got emails
- ❌ `zjones@gowaffl.com` was not verified → filtered out
- ❌ `rwright@gowaffl.com` was not verified → filtered out

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. Verified Your Domain
- **Domain:** bavsavingschallenge.com
- **Status:** VERIFIED in Resend
- **Result:** Production mode enabled - no recipient restrictions

### 2. Updated Email Sender
**Before:**
```
from: 'BAV Savings Challenge <onboarding@resend.dev>'
```

**After:**
```
from: 'BAV Savings Challenge <noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com>'
```

### 3. Updated Button Text
- Changed "Download Uploaded Document" → "Download User's Document"

### 4. Enhanced Logging
- Added detailed logging to see exactly what's sent to Resend
- Makes future debugging much easier

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Edge function deployed** with production configuration  
✅ **Domain verified** in Resend  
✅ **All 3 recipients configured**  
✅ **Production mode active**

## 🧪 Test Now!

### How to Test
1. **Submit a test document** through the BAV Savings Challenge
2. **Wait for processing** to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
3. **Check ALL 3 inboxes:**
   - ✉️ areyes@gowaffl.com
   - ✉️ zjones@gowaffl.com
   - ✉️ rwright@gowaffl.com

### What to Look For

✅ **All 3 recipients receive the email** (same email, same time)  
✅ **From:** BAV Savings Challenge <noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com>  
✅ **Subject:** New BAV Savings Challenge Submission - [Company Name]  
✅ **Button says:** "Download User's Document"  
✅ **2 download buttons work:** User's document + Internal report  
✅ **Customer details shown:** Name, company, email, phone

### First Email Notes
- **Check spam folders** the first time (new sender domain)
- After first successful delivery, future emails should go to inbox
- If in spam, mark as "Not Spam" to train email filters
