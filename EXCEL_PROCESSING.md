# Excel File Processing - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The system now has full support for accurately processing Excel files (`.xlsx` and `.xls` formats) in addition to CSV files.

## What Was Added

### 1. **SheetJS (xlsx) Library Integration**
- Added `xlsx@0.18.5` npm package import
- Handles both modern Excel (.xlsx) and legacy (.xls) formats
- Deno-compatible via npm: imports

### 2. **Binary File Handling**
- Updated `downloadFile()` function to detect Excel files
- Downloads Excel files as `ArrayBuffer` (binary data)
- Downloads CSV files as text (string data)

### 3. **Excel Parsing Logic**
- Reads first worksheet from Excel workbook
- Converts Excel sheets to array of arrays
- Intelligent header detection (same logic as CSV)
- Handles blank rows and empty cells gracefully

### 4. **Smart Header Detection**
Added `findDataHeaderFromRows()` function that:
- Scans first 20 rows to find actual data headers
- Detects common column names (SKU, OEM, Item, Product, Description, Quantity, Price, etc.)
- Skips metadata rows and blank rows
- Falls back to first row if no clear header found

### 5. **Unified Processing Pipeline**
Both Excel and CSV files now:
- Use the same product extraction logic
- Support intelligent column mapping
- Handle multiple SKU formats
- Process quantities and prices with validation
- Support all existing matching tiers (exact SKU, fuzzy, semantic, etc.)

## Supported File Formats

| Format | Extension | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Excel (Modern) | `.xlsx` | ✅ Fully Supported |
| Excel (Legacy) | `.xls` | ✅ Fully Supported |
| CSV | `.csv` | ✅ Fully Supported |
| PDF | `.pdf` | ⚠️ Accepted but not implemented yet |

## How It Works

### Excel Processing Flow:

1. **File Upload** → User uploads .xlsx or .xls file
2. **Download** → Function downloads file as binary ArrayBuffer
3. **Parse Workbook** → SheetJS reads Excel workbook structure
4. **Extract Sheet** → Gets first worksheet
5. **Convert to Array** → Converts cells to array of arrays
6. **Detect Header** → Finds header row intelligently
7. **Extract Products** → Maps columns to product data
8. **Match & Calculate** → Same processing as CSV files

### Example Excel File Structure:

```
Row 1: [Account Info]          ← Skipped (metadata)
Row 2: []                       ← Skipped (blank)
Row 3: [Item Description, OEM Number, Qty, Price, ...]  ← Header detected
Row 4: [HP 410A Black Toner, CF410A, 5, 89.99, ...]    ← Data row
Row 5: [Brother TN660, TN660, 10, 45.50, ...]          ← Data row
...
```

## Column Detection

The system intelligently detects these column types:

- **Product Name**: "Item Description", "Product Name", "Description", "Item", "Product"
- **SKU/Part Number**: "SKU", "OEM", "OEM Number", "Part Number", "Part #", "Model", "Catalog"
- **Quantity**: "Qty", "Quantity" (exact matches only to avoid wrong columns)
- **Price**: "Price", "Unit Price", "Cost", "Amount", "Sale"

### Multiple SKU Support:
If an Excel file has multiple SKU columns (e.g., "Staples SKU" AND "OEM Number"), the system:
1. Extracts all SKU values
2. Tries exact match on each SKU
3. Prefers OEM numbers over vendor SKUs
4. Falls back to other matching methods

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases to Verify:

1. **Simple Excel File**
   - Clean headers in row 1
   - Standard columns (Product, SKU, Qty, Price)
   - ✅ Should parse correctly

2. **Excel with Metadata**
   - Company info in rows 1-2
   - Headers in row 3
   - ✅ Smart header detection should find row 3

3. **Multiple SKU Columns**
   - "Staples SKU" + "OEM Number"
   - ✅ Should try both for matching

4. **Large Excel File**
   - 500+ rows
   - ✅ Chunked processing (200 items per chunk)

5. **Excel with Formulas**
   - Cells containing formulas
   - ✅ SheetJS returns calculated values

6. **Excel with Formatting**
   - Bold headers, colored cells
   - ✅ Formatting ignored, only data extracted

## Code Changes Summary

### Files Modified:
- `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`

### Functions Added:
- `findDataHeaderFromRows()` - Excel-specific header detection

### Functions Modified:
- `downloadFile()` - Now returns `string | ArrayBuffer` based on file type
- `parseDocument()` - Now accepts `string | ArrayBuffer` and handles both CSV and Excel

### Dependencies Added:
- `npm:xlsx@0.18.5` - SheetJS library for Excel parsing

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Future Improvements:

1. **Multi-Sheet Support**
   - Currently processes only first sheet
   - Could allow user to select sheet or process all sheets

2. **PDF Processing**
   - Extract tables from PDF files
   - Use OCR for scanned documents

3. **Excel Export**
   - Generate results as Excel file
   - Include formatting and charts

4. **Data Validation**
   - Detect invalid Excel structures earlier
   - Provide user feedback on column mapping

5. **Column Mapping UI**
   - Allow users to manually map columns if auto-detection fails
   - Preview first few rows before processing

## Known Limitations

1. **First Sheet Only**: Currently only processes the first worksheet in Excel files
2. **No Merged Cells**: Merged cells may cause issues with data extraction
3. **Date Formatting**: Excel dates are converted to strings
4. **File Size**: 5MB limit (set in frontend FileUpload component)

## Environment Variables Required

No new environment variables needed. Existing setup works:
- `SUPABASE_URL`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Deployment

Changes are in:
- `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`

To deploy:
```bash
# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy process-document

# Or deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Test with an Excel file
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-document \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"submissionId": "your-submission-id"}'
```

**Status**: ✅ **Implementation Complete & Ready for Testing**

The system now fully supports Excel file processing with the same intelligent matching and savings calculation as CSV files. Users can upload `.xlsx` or `.xls` files and get accurate product matching and savings reports.
