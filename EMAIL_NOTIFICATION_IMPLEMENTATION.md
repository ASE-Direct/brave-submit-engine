# Email Notification System Implementation

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Ready for Deployment

---

## üìß Overview

Implemented automatic email notifications using **Resend API** that trigger when document processing completes. Every time a user submits a document and it successfully processes, an email is sent to **areyes@gowaffl.com** with user details and secure download links.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. New Edge Function: `send-notification-email`

**File:** `supabase/functions/send-notification-email/index.ts`

**Functionality:**
- Accepts user information and document URLs
- Sends beautifully formatted HTML email via Resend API
- Includes user details in a formatted table
- Provides clickable download buttons for documents
- Handles errors gracefully with detailed logging

**Email Details:**
- **To:** areyes@gowaffl.com
- **From:** BAV Savings Challenge <onboarding@resend.dev> _(default Resend sender)_
- **Subject:** "New BAV Savings Challenge Submission - [Company Name]"

**Email Content:**
```
üìß Email Header: "New BAV Savings Challenge Submission"

User Details Table:
- Customer Name: [First Last]
- Company: [Company Name]
- Email: [user@email.com]
- Phone: [(555) 555-5555]

Download Buttons:
- üìÑ Download Uploaded Document (signed URL, 72-hour expiry)
- üìä Download Internal Report (signed URL, 72-hour expiry)

Note: Links expire in 72 hours for security
```

### 2. Updated `process-document` Function

**File:** `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`

**Changes in `saveFinalReport()` function:**
- After successful savings report insert
- Fetches phone number from `document_submissions` table
- Generates 72-hour signed URLs for:
  - Uploaded document: `{submissionId}/{original_file_name}`
  - Internal report: `{submissionId}/report-internal.pdf`
- Calls `send-notification-email` Edge Function
- Uses try-catch to ensure email failures don't break processing
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Integration Point:** Lines 3689-3764

### 3. Updated Documentation

**File:** `CURRENT_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md`

**Added:**
- New section: "‚ö° Edge Functions" documenting all Edge Functions
- Detailed documentation of `send-notification-email` function
- Updated data flow to include email notification step
- Environment variable requirements
- Error handling details

---

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Configure Resend API Key ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**

The Resend API key must be added to Supabase Edge Function secrets:

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol/settings/functions)
2. Navigate to: **Project Settings ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí Manage secrets**
3. Click "Add new secret"
4. Add secret:
   - **Name:** `RESEND_API_KEY`
   - **Value:** `re_dfAq3DA5_562WRM5RR7U4H36dd1HcSpQU`

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=re_dfAq3DA5_562WRM5RR7U4H36dd1HcSpQU
```

### Step 2: Deploy New Edge Function

Deploy the `send-notification-email` function:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /Users/alfredreyes/Desktop/Development/brave-submit-engine

# Deploy the new function
supabase functions deploy send-notification-email
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying function send-notification-email...
Function deployed successfully!
URL: https://qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol.supabase.co/functions/v1/send-notification-email
```

### Step 3: Redeploy Updated `process-document` Function

Redeploy the updated processing function with email integration:

```bash
supabase functions deploy process-document
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Deploying function process-document...
Function deployed successfully!
URL: https://qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-document
```

### Step 4: Test the Email Flow

**Test Submission:**
1. Go to your application: https://brave-submit-engine.vercel.app (or localhost)
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Upload a sample document (CSV or Excel)
4. Complete reCAPTCHA and submit
5. Wait for processing to complete

**What Should Happen:**
1. Document processes normally (check logs)
2. Reports are generated and saved
3. Email notification triggers (check Edge Function logs)
4. Email arrives at areyes@gowaffl.com within 1-2 minutes

**Check Email:**
- Subject: "New BAV Savings Challenge Submission - [Company Name]"
- Contains user details in formatted table
- Has two download buttons with working signed URLs
- Links should download the files successfully

**Verify Logs:**
```bash
# Check process-document logs
supabase functions logs process-document --limit 50

# Check email function logs
supabase functions logs send-notification-email --limit 50
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ "üìß Triggering email notification..."
- ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Generated signed URLs"
- ‚úÖ "‚úÖ Email notification sent successfully"

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Email Not Sending

**Check 1: API Key Configured**
```bash
supabase secrets list
```
Should show `RESEND_API_KEY` in the list.

**Check 2: Function Logs**
```bash
supabase functions logs send-notification-email --limit 20
```
Look for error messages from Resend API.

**Check 3: Resend API Key Valid**
Test the API key directly:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.resend.com/emails \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer re_dfAq3DA5_562WRM5RR7U4H36dd1HcSpQU" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from": "onboarding@resend.dev",
    "to": "areyes@gowaffl.com",
    "subject": "Test Email",
    "html": "<p>Test message</p>"
  }'
```

### Issue: Signed URLs Not Working

**Symptoms:** Email sends but download links return 404 or access denied.

**Check:**
1. Storage bucket is accessible
2. File paths are correct:
   - Uploaded doc: `{submissionId}/{original_filename}`
   - Internal report: `{submissionId}/report-internal.pdf`
3. Files exist in storage bucket

**Verify in Supabase Dashboard:**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí document-submissions bucket
2. Navigate to submission folder
3. Confirm files exist

### Issue: Processing Completes But No Email

**Check process-document logs:**
```bash
supabase functions logs process-document --limit 50 | grep -i email
```

Look for:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Email notification failed" - Check error message
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Could not fetch submission" - Database issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Could not generate signed URL" - Storage issue

**Common Causes:**
1. Email function not deployed
2. Network timeout calling email function
3. Missing phone number in submission record
4. Storage permission issues

---

## üîí Security Notes

### Signed URLs
- **Expiry:** 72 hours (259200 seconds)
- **Access:** Anyone with the URL can download (time-limited)
- **Storage:** URLs are not stored, generated fresh each time

### API Key Protection
- Stored as Edge Function secret (encrypted)
- Never exposed to client-side code
- Only accessible within Edge Function runtime

### Email Content
- Contains PII (name, email, phone)
- Sent only to internal recipient (areyes@gowaffl.com)
- Not stored in database

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Success Metrics

**Check Email Function Success Rate:**
```bash
supabase functions logs send-notification-email --limit 100
```

Count occurrences:
- ‚úÖ Success: "Email sent successfully"
- ‚ùå Failures: "Failed to send email notification"

**Check Processing Integration:**
```bash
supabase functions logs process-document --limit 100 | grep "Email notification"
```

Should see:
- "üìß Triggering email notification..."
- "‚úÖ Email notification sent successfully"

### Alert on Failures

Consider setting up monitoring for:
- Email send failures (Resend API errors)
- Signed URL generation failures
- Missing submission data

---

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Domain Verification (Recommended)
Currently using Resend's default sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`). For production:

1. Add your domain to Resend
2. Verify DNS records
3. Update `from` address in `send-notification-email/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'BAV Savings Challenge <notifications@gowaffl.com>',
   ```

### 2. Additional Recipients
To CC/BCC other team members:
```typescript
to: ['areyes@gowaffl.com'],
cc: ['team@gowaffl.com'],
```

### 3. Enhanced Email Template
- Add company logo
- Include savings summary in email
- Add direct link to customer report
- Attach PDFs directly instead of signed URLs

### 4. Email Preferences
- Let users opt-in to receive their own copy
- Store email preference in document_submissions
- Send customer-facing email with customer report
