# Dual Report System Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Overview

Successfully implemented a dual PDF report system with separate customer-facing and internal sales team reports, featuring enhanced executive summaries with SKU-level breakdowns and aggregated analytics.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Structures ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`

Added match type tracking and categorization to the `calculateSavings` function:

- **Match Types:**
  - `remanufactured` - Items matched with `ase_clover_number` and have savings
  - `oem` - Items matched using `ase_oem_number` (like-kind exchange, better price)
  - `no_match` - Items without matches OR matched but no savings possible

- **Summary Enhancements:**
  - `remanufactured_count` - Count of remanufactured SKU recommendations
  - `oem_count` - Count of OEM like-kind exchange opportunities
  - `no_match_count` - Count of items needing manual review (TBD)

- **Breakdown Item Fields:**
  - `match_type` - Categorization of each item
  - `ase_sku` - The ASE SKU (ase_clover_number or ase_oem_number)

### 2. Customer-Facing Report Generator ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator-customer.ts`

Created simplified 3-page report for customers:

**Page 1: Executive Summary**
- Purchase volume breakdown with unique SKU counts
- Remanufactured SKUs section with line item count
- OEM like-kind exchange section
- No match items (TBD) section
- Savings opportunity breakdown:
  - OEM Total Spend
  - BAV Total Spend
  - Total Savings with percentage (highlighted)

**Page 2: Environmental Impact & Key Benefits**
- Cartridges saved, CO2 reduced, trees equivalent
- Plastic reduced, shipping weight saved
- 8 key quality benefits (warranty, certifications, etc.)

**Page 3: Contact/CTA**
- Call to action messaging
- Contact information (email, phone, website)

**Key Features:**
- Clean, simplified design
- No line item details (internal use only)
- Professional branding throughout
- Page footers with page numbers

### 3. Internal Report Generator ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator-internal.ts`

Created detailed internal report for sales team:

**Page 1: Executive Summary**
- Same enhanced summary as customer report
- Marked as "Internal Savings Report"

**Page 2: Environmental Impact & Key Benefits**
- Same content as customer report

**Page 3+: SKU Summary Report**
- Aggregated table by unique ASE SKU
- Columns: ASE SKU | Qty | Current $ | BAV $ | Savings $
- Sorted by highest savings first
- Shows combined totals for duplicate SKUs
- Alternating row colors for readability
- Repeating headers on multiple pages

**Following Pages: Full Line Item Details**
- Simplified line items showing:
  - **Current:** Product name/description (kept for reference), quantity, price, total
  - **Recommended:** ASE SKU ONLY (no product name), quantity, price, total
  - Savings badge if applicable
  - Reason for recommendation
- 3 items per page with clean layout
- Product names removed from recommended products (internal SKU tracking)

**Key Features:**
- Marked "CONFIDENTIAL" in footer
- SKU-level aggregation for quick analysis
- Complete line item transparency
- Optimized for sales team workflow

### 4. Report Generation Updates ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`

Updated `generateReport` function:

- Generates BOTH reports simultaneously
- Imports both PDF generators dynamically
- Uploads to separate files:
  - `report.pdf` - Customer-facing
  - `report-internal.pdf` - Internal
- Returns object with both URLs: `{ customerUrl, internalUrl }`
- Updated progress messages: "Generating customer PDF..." and "Generating internal PDF..."

Updated `saveFinalReport` function:

- Accepts both URLs as parameters
- Stores both in database:
  - `pdf_url` - Customer report URL
  - `internal_pdf_url` - Internal report URL

Updated main processing flow:

- Destructures both URLs from generateReport
- Passes both to saveFinalReport
- Includes both URLs in completion progress update

### 5. Database Migration ✅

**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251017_add_internal_pdf_url.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE savings_reports
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS internal_pdf_url TEXT;

COMMENT ON COLUMN savings_reports.internal_pdf_url IS 
  'URL to internal sales team PDF report with SKU summary and detailed line items';
```

### 6. Documentation Updates ✅

**File:** `CURRENT_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md`

- Updated last modified date to October 17, 2025
- Added comprehensive "Dual Report System" entry to Recent Changes
- Documented `internal_pdf_url` column in savings_reports table
- Listed all implementation files and migration

---

## Executive Summary Features

Both reports now include enhanced executive summary with:

1. **OEM SKUs Section**
   - Total unique SKUs identified
   - Line item count
   - Total OEM market basket value

2. **Remanufactured SKUs Section**
   - Count of unique remanufactured recommendations
   - Line items using remanufactured products
   - Total remanufactured market basket value

3. **OEM Like Kind Exchange Section**
   - Count of items where same product available at better price
   - Uses ase_oem_number for tracking

4. **No Match Section**
   - Count of items needing manual review
   - Marked as "TBD" (to be determined)

5. **Savings Opportunity Breakdown**
   - OEM Total Spend (current cost)
   - BAV Total Spend (optimized cost)
   - Total Savings with percentage (highlighted in green)

---

## SKU Summary Report (Internal Only)

New feature that aggregates all line items by unique ASE SKU:

- **Groups by:** ase_clover_number OR ase_oem_number
- **Combines:** Multiple line items with same SKU
- **Shows:**
  - Total quantity across all line items
  - Total current cost
  - Total BAV cost
  - Total savings
- **Sorted by:** Highest savings first
- **Format:** Professional table with headers and alternating rows

**Example:**
```
ASE SKU           | Qty | Current $  | BAV $    | Savings $
CL-R-TN760        | 50  | $5,250.00  | $3,750.00| $1,500.00
CL-R-TN730        | 30  | $2,100.00  | $1,650.00| $450.00
```

---

## Categorization Logic

### Remanufactured (match_type: 'remanufactured')
- Item matched with ase_clover_number
- Recommendation has savings > 0
- Typically higher-yield alternatives
- Tracked in: remanufactured_count

### OEM Like-Kind Exchange (match_type: 'oem')
- Same product at better ASE price
- Uses ase_oem_number for matching
- recommendation_type: 'better_price'
- Tracked in: oem_count

### No Match / TBD (match_type: 'no_match')
- No product match found, OR
- Product matched but no savings possible (already at/below ASE price), OR
- Missing pricing data
- Tracked in: no_match_count

---

## Files Created/Modified

1. `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator-customer.ts` - Customer report (3 pages)
2. `supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator-internal.ts` - Internal report (multi-page)

## Key Differences: Customer vs Internal Reports

| Feature | Customer Report | Internal Report |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Pages** | 3 pages | Multi-page |
| **Executive Summary** | ✅ Enhanced | ✅ Enhanced |
| **Environmental/Benefits** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **SKU Summary** | ❌ | ✅ Aggregated |
| **Line Item Details** | ❌ | ✅ Simplified |
| **Product Names** | N/A | Current only |
| **Recommended SKU** | N/A | ASE SKU only |
| **Contact Page** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Footer** | Standard | "CONFIDENTIAL" |
| **Filename** | `report.pdf` | `report-internal.pdf` |

---

## Usage

### Automatic Generation
Both reports are generated automatically when document processing completes:

1. Customer sees ONLY `report.pdf` via frontend
2. Internal team can access `report-internal.pdf` via database query
3. Both URLs stored in `savings_reports` table

### Frontend Display
**File:** `src/components/ResultsPage.tsx`

Frontend should continue displaying only the customer report (`pdf_url` field). The internal report URL is stored but not exposed to customers.

### Database Query
To retrieve internal report URL:

```sql
SELECT 
  pdf_url as customer_report,
  internal_pdf_url as internal_report,
  total_cost_savings,
  savings_percentage
FROM savings_reports
WHERE submission_id = 'uuid-here';
```

- [ ] Deploy Edge Function with new code
- [ ] Test document submission end-to-end
- [ ] Verify both PDFs are generated
- [ ] Verify both URLs stored in database
- [ ] Check customer report: 3 pages, no line items
- [ ] Check internal report: SKU summary + line items
- [ ] Verify executive summary shows correct counts
- [ ] Verify SKU aggregation works correctly
- [ ] Verify match_type categorization accurate
- [ ] Test with various document types (CSV, Excel)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

The following features were discussed but NOT implemented yet:

1. **Email Delivery** - Automatic email of internal report to sales team
2. **Date Range Display** - "Purchase Volume Date Range" in executive summary
3. **Admin Dashboard** - UI to view/download internal reports
4. **Report Comparison** - Side-by-side view of customer vs internal

---

## Notes

- TypeScript linting errors for Deno imports are expected and normal
- Both report generators reuse brand colors and styling from original
- SKU summary uses Map for efficient aggregation
- Line items sorted by savings (highest first)
- Internal report clearly marked "CONFIDENTIAL"
- Customer report focuses on benefits, not implementation details

---
