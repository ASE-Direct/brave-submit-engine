━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Date: October 19, 2025
Priority: CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️  WHAT HAPPENED:

Your API keys and access tokens were accidentally committed to git and 
are currently visible in your GitHub repository history.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 EXPOSED SECRETS:

1. Resend API Key: re_dfAq3DA5_562WRM5RR7U4H36dd1HcSpQU
   → Anyone can send emails from your account

2. Supabase Access Token: sbp_b70af96ee4bffd2455a32ec9f0b1f695f129d04f
   → Full admin access to your database

3. Supabase Project Info: qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol
   → Your database could be accessed if RLS is weak

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ WHAT I'VE DONE:

I've already fixed the code to prevent future leaks:
  ✓ Updated .gitignore to block secret files
  ✓ Removed hardcoded secrets from code
  ✓ Created safe template files
  ✓ Created comprehensive security guides

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 WHAT YOU MUST DO NOW (60-90 minutes):

STEP 1 (5 min): Rotate Resend API Key
  → Open: https://resend.com/api-keys
  → Delete the old key
  → Create new key

STEP 2 (5 min): Rotate Supabase Access Token
  → Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
  → Revoke the old token
  → Create new token

STEP 3 (10 min): Verify RLS Policies
  → Open: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol/auth/policies
  → Ensure all tables have RLS enabled
  → Verify policies are restrictive

STEP 4 (5 min): Create .env File
  → Copy: cp env.example .env
  → Add your NEW secrets to .env
  → Never commit .env file

STEP 5 (30-45 min): Clean Git History
  → Install BFG: brew install bfg
  → Follow steps in: 🚨_ACTION_REQUIRED_SECURITY.md
  → This removes secrets from git history

STEP 6 (10 min): Test Everything
  → Test app starts
  → Test document submission
  → Test email notifications

❓ QUESTIONS?

Q: Is this really critical?
A: YES. Anyone with these keys can access your systems.

Q: Can I just delete the files and commit?
A: NO. Secrets remain in git history. Must clean history.

Q: What if I don't have time right now?
A: At minimum, rotate the keys (Steps 1-2). Do the rest ASAP.

Q: Will this break my app?
A: Temporarily, until you set up new keys. Follow the guide.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔒 REMEMBER:

→ Secrets in git history remain until actively removed
→ Rotating keys is not enough - must clean history
→ This is fixable, but requires action
→ The sooner you act, the safer you are
