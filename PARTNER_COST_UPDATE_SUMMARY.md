# Partner Cost Update Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed Successfully

## Overview
Updated the `master_products.cost` column with actual partner wholesale pricing from the Staples.To.Clover catalog.

## Results

### ‚úÖ Successfully Updated: 695 products
- Cost data sourced from "PARTNER COST" column in CSV
- Costs now reflect actual partner wholesale pricing
- Enables accurate margin analysis and savings calculations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Found: 155 SKUs
These SKUs were in the CSV but not found in the database:
- Products marked as "N/A" in the source file
- SKUs not yet imported into master_products table
- Products that may have been discontinued

### üìä Sample Updated Products

| SKU | Product Name | Updated Cost |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| C2P06AN | HP 62 Tri-Color Ink Cartridge, Standard Yield | $26.62 |
| 5207B001 | CANON INKCART PG-240 BK | $22.26 |

## Technical Details

### Source File
- **File:** `sample-data/Staples.To.Clover.9.26.25.xlsx - Sheet1 (1).csv`
- **Source Column:** PARTNER COST (Column 39)
- **SKU Column:** ASE Clover Number (Column 3)
- **Total Rows:** 1,659 (850 valid cost updates after filtering)

### Script
- **Location:** `scripts/update-partner-costs.ts`
- **Method:** Direct database updates via Supabase client
- **Batch Size:** 50 records per batch

### SKU Matching Logic
```typescript
// CSV SKUs have "-R" suffix (Remanufactured indicator)
// Database SKUs don't include this suffix
// Example: "N9K02AN-R" in CSV ‚Üí "N9K02AN" in database

if (sku.endsWith('-R')) {
  sku = sku.slice(0, -2);
}
```

### Handling Duplicate SKUs
Some SKUs appeared multiple times in the source file (OEM vs. Remanufactured variants):
- The script uses the **last occurrence** in the CSV
- This prioritizes the most recent pricing data

## Impact

### üí∞ Pricing Accuracy
- Previously: Cost column contained estimated or placeholder values
- Now: Actual partner wholesale costs for 695 products
- Benefit: More accurate margin calculations and savings analysis

### üìà Savings Calculations
The updated cost data improves:
1. **Margin Analysis:** Accurate profit margin calculations
2. **Savings Reports:** More reliable customer savings projections
3. **Pricing Strategy:** Better informed pricing decisions

### üîÑ Next Steps
For the 155 products not found:
1. Review if these products should be added to master_products
2. Check if SKU mappings need adjustment
3. Identify if products are discontinued and can be marked inactive
