# Executive Summary Restructure - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully restructured the executive summary and categorization system to separate OEM SKUs (items without remanufactured matches) from Remanufactured SKUs (items with -R matches and savings). Savings calculations are now based ONLY on Remanufactured items.

## Date Implemented
October 19, 2025

---

## What Was Changed

### 1. Categorization Logic (process-document/index.ts)

**Updated `determineMatchType()` function:**
- New signature: `determineMatchType(matchedProduct, hasSavings, hasAsePrice)`
- Now returns: `'remanufactured' | 'oem_only' | 'no_match'`

**New Categories:**
- **`remanufactured`**: Has `ase_clover_number` AND `ase_price` AND savings > 0
- **`oem_only`**: Has a match (ase_oem_number or ase_clover_number) but NO `ase_price`, OR customer already at/below ASE price
- **`no_match`**: True no match (not in database at all)

### 2. Summary Calculation Structure

**Old Structure:**
```typescript
{
  total_current_cost: number,
  total_optimized_cost: number,
  total_cost_savings: number,
  savings_percentage: number,
  remanufactured_count: number,
  oem_count: number,
  no_match_count: number
}
```

**New Structure:**
```typescript
{
  // OEM Section (items without -R match or with -R but no ase_price)
  oem_section: {
    unique_items: number,           // Count of unique customer SKUs
    line_items: number,             // Total line items in this category
    rd_tba_count: number,           // True no match (R&D TBA)
    oem_only_count: number,         // Has match but no ase_price
    total_oem_basket: number        // Current cost for OEM items
  },
  
  // Remanufactured Section (items with -R and ase_price and savings)
  reman_section: {
    unique_items: number,           // Count of unique customer SKUs with -R matches
    line_items: number,             // Total line items in this category
    total_reman_basket: number      // Current cost for Reman items
  },
  
  // Savings (ONLY from Remanufactured items)
  savings_breakdown: {
    oem_total_spend: number,        // Current cost for Reman items only
    bav_total_spend: number,        // Optimized cost for Reman items only
    total_savings: number,          // Difference
    savings_percentage: number      // (total_savings / oem_total_spend) * 100
  },
  
  // Backwards compatibility
  total_items: number,
  items_with_savings: number,
  environmental: { ... }
}
```

### 3. Tracking During Processing

**New Tracking Variables:**
```typescript
// OEM Section trackers
let oemUniqueSkus = new Set<string>();
let oemLineItems = 0;
let oemTotalBasket = 0;
let rdTbaCount = 0;      // True no match
let oemOnlyCount = 0;    // Has match but no ase_price

// Remanufactured Section trackers
let remanUniqueSkus = new Set<string>();
let remanLineItems = 0;
let remanCurrentCost = 0;    // What customer currently pays
let remanOptimizedCost = 0;  // What customer would pay with us
let remanSavings = 0;        // Difference
```

### 4. PDF Reports Updated

**Customer PDF (`pdf-generator-customer.ts`):**
- Page 1: Executive Summary with OEM SKUs, Remanufactured SKUs, and Savings Opportunity Breakdown
- OEM section shows: unique items, line items, R&D TBA count, OEM Only count, OEM Mkt. basket
- Remanufactured section shows: unique items, line items, Reman Mkt. basket
- Savings based only on Remanufactured items

**Internal PDF (`pdf-generator-internal.ts`):**
- Same executive summary structure as customer PDF
- Includes SKU Summary Report (aggregated by customer's input SKU)
- Includes full line item details with ASE SKUs

---

## Key Business Rules

### Item Categorization Flow

1. **No match in database** → OEM Section (R&D TBA)
2. **Match found but no `ase_price`** → OEM Section (OEM Only)
3. **Match found but customer already at/below ASE price** → OEM Section (OEM Only)
4. **Match with `ase_clover_number` AND `ase_price` AND savings > 0** → Remanufactured Section
5. **Match with only `ase_oem_number` AND `ase_price` AND savings > 0** → OEM Section (OEM Only)

### Savings Calculation

**CRITICAL:** Savings are calculated ONLY from Remanufactured items.

- OEM Total Spend = Sum of current costs for Remanufactured items
- BAV Total Spend = Sum of optimized costs for Remanufactured items
- Total Savings = OEM Total Spend - BAV Total Spend
- Savings Percentage = (Total Savings / OEM Total Spend) × 100

**Items NOT included in savings:**
- Items in OEM section (no savings opportunity)
- Items with no match (R&D TBA)
- Items already at or below ASE price

## Example Report Structure

### Executive Summary (Both Reports)

```
OEM SKUs (19 unique)
  (74) line items
  (9) R&D TBA
  (28) OEM Only
  $8,445.17 OEM Mkt. basket

Remanufactured SKUs (57 unique)
  (233) line items
  $25,664.38 Reman. Mkt. basket

Savings Opportunity Breakdown
  ✓ OEM Total Spend: $25,664.38
  ✓ BAV Total Spend: $18,122.25
  ✓ Total Savings: $7,542.13
  ✓ Avg. Savings: 29.4%
```

## Testing Checklist

To verify the implementation:

1. ✅ Upload a CSV with mix of OEM and Remanufactured items
2. ✅ Verify OEM section counts (R&D TBA vs OEM Only)
3. ✅ Verify Remanufactured section counts (only items with -R and price)
4. ✅ Verify savings calculations use ONLY Remanufactured items
5. ✅ Verify unique items count is based on customer's input SKUs
6. ✅ Verify both customer and internal reports match expected structure

## Notes

- Unique items are always counted from the customer's input SKUs, not our recommended ASE products
- The system now clearly separates items we can provide savings on (Remanufactured) from items we cannot (OEM)
- "OEM Only" includes both items we don't have pricing for AND items where customer is already at our price
- "R&D TBA" is for true no-match items that require research and development
