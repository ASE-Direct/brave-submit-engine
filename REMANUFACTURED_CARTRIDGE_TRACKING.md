# Remanufactured/Reused Cartridge Environmental Impact Tracking

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Enhanced the environmental impact calculation to include remanufactured and reused cartridges in the total cartridge savings. Previously, only higher-yield recommendations were counted as cartridge savings. Now, any item with `unit_price > 0` is recognized as a remanufactured or reused cartridge that prevents waste.

## Business Logic

### The Problem
The system was only counting cartridges saved through higher-yield recommendations (e.g., 5 standard → 3 XL = 2 cartridges saved). However, offering remanufactured or reused cartridges also prevents cartridges from going to waste.

### The Solution
Items with `unit_price > 0` represent cartridges that can be offered (either OEM, remanufactured, or compatible). Each of these cartridges, when purchased through ASE, represents a cartridge saved from the waste stream through remanufacturing or reuse.

**Total Environmental Impact = Higher-Yield Savings + Remanufactured/Reused Cartridge Savings**

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

The environmental impact calculation now occurs in **three scenarios** within the `calculateSavings()` function:

#### Scenario 1: Higher-Yield + Remanufactured (Lines 3098-3146)
When basic price savings is better than higher-yield recommendation:
```typescript
// Environmental impact for remanufactured/reused cartridges
if (effectiveUserPrice > 0 && item.quantity > 0) {
  const cartridgesSavedHere = item.quantity;
  cartridgesSaved += cartridgesSavedHere;
  const isToner = matchedProduct.category === 'toner_cartridge';
  const co2PerCartridge = isToner ? 5.2 : 2.5;
  const shippingWeightPerCartridge = isToner ? 2.5 : 0.2;
  
  co2Reduced += cartridgesSavedHere * co2PerCartridge;
  plasticReduced += cartridgesSavedHere * 2; // 2 lbs plastic per cartridge
  shippingWeightSaved += cartridgesSavedHere * shippingWeightPerCartridge;
}
```

#### Scenario 2: No Higher-Yield Option (Lines 3164-3211)
When there's no higher-yield option but basic savings exist:
- Same environmental impact logic applied
- Counts item quantity as cartridges saved

#### Scenario 3: No Cost Savings (Lines 3228-3272)
When item is already at or below ASE price (no cost savings):
- **Still counts environmental impact**
- Updates database with environmental_savings even without cost savings
- Recognizes that remanufactured cartridges prevent waste regardless of pricing

### Database Updates

The `environmental_savings` JSONB field in `order_items_extracted` now includes:
```typescript
environmental_savings: {
  cartridges_saved: number,        // Full item quantity
  co2_reduced: number,             // quantity × (5.2 for toner OR 2.5 for ink)
  plastic_reduced: number,         // quantity × 2 lbs
  shipping_weight_saved: number    // quantity × (2.5 for toner OR 0.2 for ink)
}
```

This is set for **all items** with `unit_price > 0`, not just higher-yield recommendations.

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Higher-Yield Only (Previous Behavior)
- **Order:** 5 HP 64 Standard Ink (300 pages each)
- **Recommendation:** 3 HP 64XL (600 pages each)
- **Cartridges Saved:** 2 (from higher-yield)
- **Environmental Impact:** CO2, plastic, shipping weight for 2 cartridges

### Example 2: Remanufactured Only (New Behavior)
- **Order:** 10 HP 26A Toner (remanufactured, already at ASE price)
- **Recommendation:** Same product, no cost savings
- **Cartridges Saved:** 10 (all remanufactured)
- **Environmental Impact:** CO2, plastic, shipping weight for 10 cartridges
- **Note:** Previous system would have shown 0 cartridges saved

### Example 3: Combined (New Behavior)
- **Order:**
  - 5 HP 64 Standard → 3 HP 64XL (higher-yield)
  - 10 HP 26A Toner (remanufactured, no cost savings)
- **Total Cartridges Saved:** 12 cartridges
  - 2 from higher-yield optimization
  - 10 from remanufactured cartridges
- **Environmental Impact:** Combined CO2, plastic, shipping weight for all 12

## Impact on Reporting

### PDF Reports
- Environmental Impact section shows total cartridges saved (both sources)
- Individual line items include environmental_savings for all priced items
- **NEW: "[Remanufactured]" tag** displayed next to recommended product names with `unit_price > 0`
  - Appears **only on Recommended products** (not Current products)
  - Format: `Product Name [Remanufactured]`
  - Helps users visually identify what we're suggesting as remanufactured items
- More accurate representation of ASE's environmental contribution

### Database
- `savings_reports.cartridges_saved` reflects total from both sources
- `order_items_extracted.environmental_savings` populated for all items with pricing
- Historical reports maintain consistency

### User Experience
- Customers see full environmental benefit of remanufactured cartridges
- Even items without cost savings show environmental impact
- Better demonstrates value proposition beyond just cost savings

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`supabase/functions/process-document/index.ts`**
   - Lines 3098-3146: Added remanufactured tracking to basic savings branch
   - Lines 3164-3211: Added remanufactured tracking to no-higher-yield branch
   - Lines 3228-3272: Added remanufactured tracking to no-savings branch
   - All three branches now track environmental impact for items with `unit_price > 0`

2. **`supabase/functions/shared/pdf-generator.ts`**
   - Lines 452-457: Added "[Remanufactured]" tag to recommended product names only
   - Tag is appended when `unit_price > 0` for clear visual identification
   - Format: `Product Name [Remanufactured]`
   - Current products do NOT receive the tag (only recommendations are tagged)

3. **`ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT_ENHANCEMENT.md`**
   - Added "Scenario 2: Remanufactured/Reused Cartridges" section
   - Updated calculation flow documentation
   - Added Example 2 and Example 3 showing combined calculations

4. **`CURRENT_SUPABASE_SCHEMA.md`**
   - Updated "Recent Changes" section with remanufactured tracking feature
   - Added "Cartridge Savings Calculation" section to environmental impact documentation
   - Clarified that cartridges_saved includes both higher-yield and remanufactured

## Validation Logic

The system only counts environmental impact when:
1. `effectiveUserPrice > 0` (item has pricing, can be offered)
2. `item.quantity > 0` (item has quantity)
3. Product is matched to catalog (has category for toner/ink determination)

This ensures we only count actual cartridges that can be offered and prevents false positives.

## Environmental Constants

| Constant | Toner | Ink | Purpose |
|----------|-------|-----|---------|
| CO2 per cartridge | 5.2 lbs | 2.5 lbs | Manufacturing impact |
| Plastic per cartridge | 2.0 lbs | 2.0 lbs | Plastic waste |
| Shipping weight | 2.5 lbs | 0.2 lbs | Transportation impact |

```

**Recommended Product (With Tag when unit_price > 0):**
```
Recommended: HP 26X High Yield Toner [Remanufactured]
SKU: CF226X | Wholesaler: W2021X
6 × $65.00 = $390.00
```

**Example in PDF Report:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Current: HP 26A Black Toner Cartridge       │
│ SKU: CF226A | Wholesaler: W2021A            │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Console Logging

Added clear logging for remanufactured cartridge tracking:
```
♻️  Remanufactured/Reused: 10 cartridge(s) saved from waste
```

This appears in the processing logs whenever remanufactured/reused environmental impact is calculated.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with remanufactured-only orders** (no higher-yield recommendations)
   - Verify cartridges_saved > 0
   - Verify environmental_savings populated
   - Verify "[Remanufactured]" tag appears in PDF

2. **Test with mixed orders** (higher-yield + remanufactured)
   - Verify total = sum of both sources
   - Verify individual items have correct environmental_savings
   - Verify "[Remanufactured]" tag on priced items only

3. **Test with no-savings items** (already at ASE price)
   - Verify environmental impact still calculated
   - Verify environmental_savings in database
   - Verify "[Remanufactured]" tag still appears

4. **Test with no-price items** (effectiveUserPrice = 0)
   - Verify environmental impact NOT calculated
   - Verify no false positives
   - Verify NO "[Remanufactured]" tag (unit_price = 0)

5. **Test PDF Display**
   - Verify "[Remanufactured]" tag is readable and well-formatted
   - Verify tag doesn't break line wrapping
   - Verify tag appears ONLY on Recommended products (not Current)
   - Verify tag appears when recommended product has unit_price > 0
   - Check that long product names with tag still fit properly
