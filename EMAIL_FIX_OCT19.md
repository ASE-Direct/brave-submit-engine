# 📧 Email Notification Fix - October 19, 2025

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Recipients Not Updated
**Problem:** Despite showing 3 recipients in logs, Resend was only receiving 1 recipient
- Edge function logs: "Sending email notification to areyes@gowaffl.com, zjones@gowaffl.com, rwright@gowaffl.com"
- Resend API logs: `"to": ["areyes@gowaffl.com"]` (only 1 recipient!)

**Root Cause:** Previous deployment may not have fully propagated or was cached

### Issue 2: Button Text
**Problem:** Button text said "Download Uploaded Document" 
**Requested:** Change to "Download User's Document"

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Recipients Array Variable
Created a dedicated recipients array variable to ensure consistency:

```typescript
// Define recipients
const recipients = ['areyes@gowaffl.com', 'zjones@gowaffl.com', 'rwright@gowaffl.com'];
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed logging to debug the issue:

```typescript
console.log('📧 Sending email notification to 3 recipients:');
console.log(`   Recipients: ${recipients.join(', ')}`);
console.log(`   User: ${userInfo.firstName} ${userInfo.lastName} (${userInfo.company})`);

// ... later ...

console.log('📤 Sending to Resend API with payload:');
console.log(`   to: ${JSON.stringify(emailPayload.to)}`);
console.log(`   from: ${emailPayload.from}`);
console.log(`   subject: ${emailPayload.subject}`);
```

This will show EXACTLY what's being sent to Resend in the edge function logs.

### 3. Updated Button Text
Changed in both HTML and plain text versions:

**HTML Button:**
```html
📄 Download User's Document
```

**Plain Text:**
```
- User's Document: [URL]
```

## 🚀 Deployment

**Deployed:** October 19, 2025  
**Command:**
```bash
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="sbp_b70af96ee4bffd2455a32ec9f0b1f695f129d04f"
npx supabase functions deploy send-notification-email --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol --no-verify-jwt
```

**Status:** ✅ Successfully deployed

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix
1. Submit a test document through the BAV Savings Challenge
2. Check edge function logs in Supabase for:
   ```
   📧 Sending email notification to 3 recipients:
      Recipients: areyes@gowaffl.com, zjones@gowaffl.com, rwright@gowaffl.com
   📤 Sending to Resend API with payload:
      to: ["areyes@gowaffl.com","zjones@gowaffl.com","rwright@gowaffl.com"]
   ```

3. Check all THREE email inboxes:
   - ✉️ areyes@gowaffl.com
   - ✉️ zjones@gowaffl.com
   - ✉️ rwright@gowaffl.com

4. Verify button text says "Download User's Document"

### Expected Results
- ✅ All 3 recipients receive the email
- ✅ Button text shows "Download User's Document"
- ✅ Edge function logs show array of 3 emails being sent to Resend
- ✅ Resend logs show `"to": ["areyes@gowaffl.com","zjones@gowaffl.com","rwright@gowaffl.com"]`

## 🔍 Debugging Next Steps

If the issue persists after this deployment:

### Check Edge Function Logs
Look for these new log messages:
1. `📧 Sending email notification to 3 recipients:`
2. `Recipients: areyes@gowaffl.com, zjones@gowaffl.com, rwright@gowaffl.com`
3. `📤 Sending to Resend API with payload:`
4. `to: ["areyes@gowaffl.com","zjones@gowaffl.com","rwright@gowaffl.com"]`

### If Still Only 1 Recipient
This would indicate a potential issue with:
- Edge function deployment/caching
- Possible multiple versions deployed
- Resend API configuration limits

**Solution:** 
```bash
# List all deployed functions
npx supabase functions list --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol

# Delete and redeploy
npx supabase functions delete send-notification-email --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol
npx supabase functions deploy send-notification-email --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol --no-verify-jwt
```

### Check Resend Account
- Verify the Resend account isn't in sandbox mode (sandbox mode has restrictions)
- Check if there are any recipient limits configured
- Verify all email addresses are valid and not blocked
