## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: No Email Received

**Step 1: Check Spam/Junk Folder**
- Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` might be filtered
- Add to safe senders list

**Step 2: Verify Processing Completed**
```bash
# Check if processing finished successfully
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="sbp_b70af96ee4bffd2455a32ec9f0b1f695f129d04f"
npx supabase functions logs process-document --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol --limit 10
```
Look for: "‚úÖ Processing complete"

**Step 3: Check Email Function Logs**
```bash
npx supabase functions logs send-notification-email --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol --limit 10
```
Look for errors or "‚úÖ Email sent successfully"

**Step 4: Verify API Key**
```bash
npx supabase secrets list --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol
```
Should show `RESEND_API_KEY` in the list

### Issue: Signed URLs Not Working

**Symptoms:** Email arrives but download links return 404 or access denied

**Check Storage:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol/storage/buckets
2. Navigate to `document-submissions` bucket
3. Find the submission folder (UUID)
4. Verify files exist:
   - Original uploaded file (e.g., `sample.xlsx`)
   - `report-internal.pdf`

**Check Permissions:**
- Storage bucket should allow signed URL generation
- Service role should have access

### Issue: Email Sent But Missing Information

**Check Submission Data:**
- Ensure phone number was submitted with the form
- Verify all required fields in document_submissions table

**Check Logs for Data Issues:**
```bash
npx supabase functions logs process-document --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol | grep -i "submission"
```

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### 1. Domain Verification (Recommended for Production)

Currently using Resend's default sender (`onboarding@resend.dev`). To use your own domain:

1. Log in to Resend: https://resend.com/domains
2. Add domain: `gowaffl.com`
3. Add DNS records (provided by Resend)
4. Verify domain
5. Update sender in `send-notification-email/index.ts`:
   ```typescript
   from: 'BAV Savings Challenge <notifications@gowaffl.com>',
   ```
6. Redeploy function

### 2. Add More Recipients

To notify multiple team members:

**Edit:** `supabase/functions/send-notification-email/index.ts`

```typescript
to: ['areyes@gowaffl.com', 'team@gowaffl.com'],
// or use cc/bcc
cc: ['sales@gowaffl.com'],
```

### 3. Send Copy to Customer

Add option to send customer-facing email:

```typescript
// In send-notification-email function
// Add second email with customer report instead of internal report
```

### 4. Email Templates

Create branded email templates:
- Add company logo
- Custom styling
- Include savings summary preview
- Add CTA buttons
