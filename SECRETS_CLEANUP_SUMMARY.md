**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

---

## üö® SECURITY INCIDENT SUMMARY

2. **Supabase Access Token:** `sbp_b70af96ee4bffd2455a32ec9f0b1f695f129d04f`
3. **Supabase Project Reference:** `qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol`
4. **Supabase Anon Key:** (in `src/lib/supabase.ts`)
5. **Notification Email:** `areyes@gowaffl.com`

### Files Affected
- `EMAIL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md` (committed in git history)
- `EMAIL_DEBUG_GUIDE.md` (committed in git history)
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (committed in git history)
- `deploy-email-notification.sh` (committed in git history)
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` (hardcoded credentials)

---

## ‚úÖ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS COMPLETED

### 1. Updated `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
Added comprehensive rules to prevent future secret leaks:
- Blocked all secret/key files (`*.secret`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, etc.)
- Gitignored specific documentation files with secrets
- Added deployment scripts to ignore list
- Added secret directories to ignore list

**File:** `.gitignore`

### 2. Removed Hardcoded Credentials ‚úÖ
Updated `src/lib/supabase.ts` to:
- Remove hardcoded Supabase URL and anon key
- Require environment variables
- Throw clear error if variables are missing
- Added security warnings in comments

**File:** `src/lib/supabase.ts`

### 3. Created Template Files ‚úÖ
Created sanitized template files with placeholders:
- `EMAIL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.template.md` - Deployment guide with `[YOUR_*]` placeholders
- `deploy-email-notification.sh.template` - Deployment script template
- `env.example` - Environment variable template

These files are safe to commit and share publicly.

### 4. Created Security Documentation ‚úÖ
Created comprehensive security guide:
- `SECURITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete security setup and remediation guide

### 5. Created This Summary ‚úÖ
Documented the incident and remediation steps.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED ACTIONS (YOU MUST DO THESE)

### CRITICAL - Do Immediately

#### 1. Rotate Resend API Key üî¥
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Anyone with this key can send emails from your account

```bash
# Steps:
1. Go to: https://resend.com/api-keys
2. Delete key: re_dfAq3DA5_562WRM5RR7U4H36dd1HcSpQU
3. Create new API key
4. Save new key in your password manager
5. Update Edge Function secret (see below)
```

#### 2. Rotate Supabase Access Token üî¥
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Full admin access to your Supabase project

```bash
# Steps:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens
2. Revoke token: sbp_b70af96ee4bffd2455a32ec9f0b1f695f129d04f
3. Create new access token
4. Save in password manager
5. Update local environment (see below)
```

#### 3. Review Supabase RLS Policies üü°
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM - Ensure Row Level Security is properly configured

```bash
# Check your RLS policies:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol/auth/policies
2. Verify each table has RLS enabled
3. Verify policies restrict access appropriately
4. Test with anon key to ensure protection
```

#### 4. Configure Environment Variables üü¢
Create a `.env` file with your NEW secrets:

```bash
# Copy the example
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your NEW secrets
nano .env

# Never commit this file!
```

#### 5. Update Edge Function Secrets üü¢
Set your NEW Resend API key in Supabase:

```bash
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_NEW_access_token"
npx supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY="your_NEW_resend_key" --project-ref qpiijzpslfjwikigrbol
```

#### 6. Clean Git History üî¥
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Secrets remain in git history until removed

Choose one method:

**Option A: Using BFG Repo-Cleaner (Easiest)**
```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg

# Clone mirror
git clone --mirror https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/brave-submit-engine.git
cd brave-submit-engine.git

# Remove sensitive files from ALL history
bfg --delete-files EMAIL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
bfg --delete-files EMAIL_DEBUG_GUIDE.md
bfg --delete-files EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
bfg --delete-files deploy-email-notification.sh

# Clean up
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive

# Force push (coordinate with team!)
git push --force
```

**Option B: Using git-filter-repo**
```bash
brew install git-filter-repo

git filter-repo --invert-paths \
  --path EMAIL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md \
  --path EMAIL_DEBUG_GUIDE.md \
  --path EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md \
  --path deploy-email-notification.sh

git push --force --all
```

**Option C: Start Fresh (Most Secure)**
1. Create new repository
2. Copy code (excluding sensitive files)
3. Initialize new git history
4. Archive old repository

---

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After completing the required actions, verify everything:

### Security Verification
- [ ] Old Resend API key has been deleted
- [ ] Old Supabase access token has been revoked
- [ ] New secrets are stored in `.env` (not committed)
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `src/lib/supabase.ts` has no hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Edge Function secrets updated with new keys
- [ ] RLS policies reviewed and secured
- [ ] Git history cleaned (secrets removed)

### Functional Verification
- [ ] Application starts successfully with new environment variables
- [ ] Document submission works
- [ ] Email notifications work with new API key
- [ ] Supabase CLI works with new access token
- [ ] Edge Functions deployed successfully

### Git Verification
```bash
# Verify .env is gitignored
git status
# Should NOT show .env as untracked

# Verify sensitive files are ignored
git add EMAIL_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md
# Should warn it's gitignored

# Check for any remaining secrets
git log --all -p | grep -i "re_dfAq3DA5"
# Should return empty after history cleanup
```

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION MEASURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Enhanced `.gitignore`
- Prevents `.env` files from being committed
- Blocks documentation with sensitive data
- Ignores deployment scripts with secrets
- Blocks all secret/key file extensions

### 2. Environment Variable Enforcement
- Code now REQUIRES environment variables
- Throws error if secrets are missing
- No fallback to hardcoded values

### 3. Template Files
- Safe templates with placeholders
- Can be committed and shared publicly
- Clear instructions for users

### 4. Documentation
- Comprehensive security guide
- Best practices documented
- Incident response procedures

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### High Risk Items
1. **Resend API Key**
   - Impact: Unauthorized email sending, cost incurring
   - Mitigation: Rotate key immediately, monitor Resend dashboard

2. **Supabase Access Token**
   - Impact: Full admin access to project
   - Mitigation: Revoke immediately, review access logs

### Medium Risk Items
3. **Supabase Project Ref + Anon Key**
   - Impact: Database access IF RLS is misconfigured
   - Mitigation: Verify RLS policies, monitor database logs

### Low Risk Items
4. **Notification Email**
   - Impact: Spam to email address
   - Mitigation: None needed, not a security concern

---

## üîÑ ONGOING SECURITY PRACTICES

### Daily
- Review code before committing for hardcoded secrets
- Check `git status` before committing

### Weekly
- Review access logs in Supabase dashboard
- Monitor Resend usage for anomalies

### Monthly
- Rotate API keys and tokens
- Audit RLS policies
- Review `.gitignore` for completeness

### Before Each Commit
```bash
# Scan for secrets
git diff --cached | grep -i "api_key\|secret\|token\|password"

# Verify no .env files staged
git status | grep -i ".env"
```
