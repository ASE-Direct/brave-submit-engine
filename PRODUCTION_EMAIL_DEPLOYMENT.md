## 🧪 Testing

### How to Verify It's Working

1. **Submit a test document** through the BAV Savings Challenge form
2. **Wait for processing** to complete
3. **Check all 3 inboxes:**
   - areyes@gowaffl.com
   - zjones@gowaffl.com
   - rwright@gowaffl.com

### Expected Results

✅ **All 3 recipients receive the email**  
✅ **From address shows:** BAV Savings Challenge <noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com>  
✅ **Subject:** New BAV Savings Challenge Submission - [Company Name]  
✅ **Button text:** "Download User's Document"  
✅ **Both documents accessible** via 72-hour signed URLs

### Check Edge Function Logs
Look for these messages in Supabase logs:
```
📧 Sending email notification to 3 recipients:
   Recipients: areyes@gowaffl.com, zjones@gowaffl.com, rwright@gowaffl.com
📤 Sending to Resend API with payload:
   to: ["areyes@gowaffl.com","zjones@gowaffl.com","rwright@gowaffl.com"]
   from: BAV Savings Challenge <noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com>
✅ Email sent successfully
```

### Check Resend Logs
Should now show:
```json
{
  "from": "BAV Savings Challenge <noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com>",
  "to": ["areyes@gowaffl.com", "zjones@gowaffl.com", "rwright@gowaffl.com"]
}
```

## 🎯 Why This Fixes The Issue

### The Problem Was:
- **Sandbox mode** (`onboarding@resend.dev`) only allows verified recipients
- Only `areyes@gowaffl.com` was verified
- Other two recipients were filtered out by Resend

### The Solution:
- **Verified domain** (`bavsavingschallenge.com`) enables production mode
- Production mode has **no recipient restrictions**
- All emails go through without filtering

## 📋 Domain Verification Details

**Domain:** bavsavingschallenge.com  
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED in Resend  
**DNS Records:** Configured (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)  
**Email Address:** noreply@bavsavingschallenge.com

### Benefits of Verified Domain

✅ **No recipient restrictions** - send to any email address  
✅ **Better deliverability** - proper SPF/DKIM records  
✅ **Professional appearance** - branded sender address  
✅ **Higher sending limits** - production tier quotas  
✅ **Better spam score** - verified domain reputation

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

### Sender Address
- Using `noreply@` prefix (standard for automated emails)
- No need to monitor this inbox
- Recipients can still reply (will bounce with clear message)

### Domain Reputation
- Keep domain in good standing
- Monitor bounce rates
- Watch for spam complaints
- Resend provides reputation metrics

### API Key
- Using production Resend API key
- Stored securely in Supabase secrets
- Key: `RESEND_API_KEY`

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Email Delivery

**Resend Dashboard:**
- View all sent emails: https://resend.com/emails
- Check delivery status
- Monitor bounce/complaint rates
- View open rates (if tracking enabled)

**Supabase Logs:**
- Monitor edge function execution
- Check for any errors
- View detailed request/response logs

### Success Metrics

Track these for each submission:
- ✅ Email sent successfully (check logs)
- ✅ All 3 recipients received email
- ✅ No bounces reported
- ✅ Documents accessible via signed URLs
